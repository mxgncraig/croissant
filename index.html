    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape,
      the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
